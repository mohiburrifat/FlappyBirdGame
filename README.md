#Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a Java-based clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, built using the Swing framework for the graphical user interface. The game features simple yet engaging mechanics where the player controls a bird that must navigate through a series of pipes without colliding.

Features
*Custom Graphics: The game includes custom images for the bird, background, and pipes.

*Smooth Animation: The game uses a game loop powered by a Timer, updating at 60 frames per second to ensure smooth gameplay.

*Scoring System: The score increases as the bird successfully passes through pipe pairs, with a "Game Over" message and final score displayed at the top center of the screen when the bird crashes.

*Basic Controls: The player can control the bird using the spacebar to make it "flap" and gain altitude.

*Responsive UI: Buttons for starting, pausing, and resuming the game are integrated into the interface.


Future Improvements

*Enhanced Graphics: Plan to update with more detailed sprites and animations.

*Sound Effects: Adding background music and sound effects for flapping and collisions.

*Difficulty Levels: Implementing adjustable difficulty settings with varying pipe speeds and gaps.
